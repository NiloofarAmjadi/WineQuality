predict the wine quality, which has a score between 0 and 10 from the 11 given features

This assignment uses the Wine Quality Dataset at the UCI repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality. The model will predict the wine quality, which has a score between 0 and 10 from the 11 given features:

1 - fixed acidity 2 - volatile acidity 3 - citric acid 4 - residual sugar 5 - chlorides 6 - free sulfur dioxide 7 - total sulfur dioxide 8 - density 9 - pH 10 - sulfates 11 - alcohol

Build the model for predicting the wine quality. Containerize the model and deploy it on Heroku.

    Use linear regression to repeat problem 1 in two different ways on the AWS SageMaker studio Lab as follows:

    a) Without container technology. The objective is to code and build an ML project in AWS SageMaker.

    b) With container technology using. The objective is to use the container technology in SageMaker o build the project.
